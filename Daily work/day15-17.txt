NUMPY:
the numpy is a numerical python it is an open-source Python library that's used for scientific computing and data analysis. it is a general perpos librery that helps us perfoem complex numerical task on the array of the numbers it also provides us the method to create numpy 1D 2D 3D array that can be very usefull theare called as ndarray,can be up to 50 times faster than traditional Python lists.

NumPy's features include:
N-dimensional arrays: NumPy's powerful arrays speed up data processing.
Functions: NumPy has a large library of functions that operate efficiently on arrays, including mathematical functions, linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities.
Interfacing: NumPy can be easily integrated with other Python packages and programming languages like C and C++. 


there are various operations using the numpy array:
import numpy as np
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
arr2 = np.zeros(5)
arr3 = np.ones((2, 3))
arr4 = np.random.rand(3, 2)

np.zeros=prints the array of all zeors in a array
np.ones=prints the array of all ones in a array
np.random.rand=it will print the array of 2D and having 3 elements in each

you can also make some maths operation on the array of numbers:
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
add = arr1 + arr2
sub = arr1 - arr2
mul = arr1 * arr2
div = arr1 / arr2

in this each element of the arr1 gets add,sub,mul,div with element on the same index of the arr2.


we also have some inbuild functions for the maths operations:
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
sum = np.sum(arr)
mean = np.mean(arr)
max = np.max(arr)
min = np.min(arr)

the functions are shown above will also help in add,sub,mul,div..

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
reshaped = arr.reshape(5, 1)
transposed = arr.T
flattened = arr.flatten()

.reshape()=it will reshape the array into 5*1 shape

.T = will make a transpose of the array

.flatten()=will print the flattern array

we can also perform some slicing operations on the array so that we can get only the required elements

BROADCASTING in numpy:
it is a very powerful feature in numpy which allows you ti perform arthemathic operations on the numpy array even if they are of different shapes you don't need to reshape() them
It is also called as "stretching" or "broadcasting"

Broadcasting process:
The smaller array is conceptually replicated along the missing dimensions to match the shape of the larger array. This replication happens internally, without actually creating copies of the data, making it efficient.
Example:
import numpy as np
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
print(a.shape)
b = 2
print(b.shape)         
result = a + b
print(result)
output=[3,4,5]

this is known as broadcasting:
Efficiency
Conciseness
Flexibility

VECTORIZATION:
it is a technique in numpy that applies a operation on the whole array instead of appliying it by iterating over the array

Benefits of Vectorization:
Speed
Conciseness 
Efficiency

Example:

import numpy as np
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
result = []
for i in range(len(arr1)):
    result.append(arr1[i] + arr2[i])
print(result)

OPERATIONS ON THE MULTIDIMENTIONAL ARRAY:

1)Advanced slicong:
code:array[r:c]
i.e when we are slicing the ndarray we have to define the specific column and the row and hence we write the above code
Example:
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
print(arr[[0, 1], [1, 2]]) 
print(arr[arr > 5]) 

in this we will get the 0th index row  and the 1st index column
and the 

2)Reshaping and Transposing:
we can take the transpose of the and also rehape the array in certain shape that are accepted by that original array in numpy
Example:
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(arr.reshape(3, 2))
print(arr.transpose())

3)Linear Algebra Operations:
NumPy offers powerful linear algebra capabilities through the np.linalg module. This includes matrix multiplication, solving linear equations, finding determinants, and much more.
Example:
a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])
print(np.dot(a, b)) 
print(np.linalg.inv(a)) 

4) Statistical Functions:
numpy also provides numerous statistical functions for calculating mean, median, variance, standard deviation, correlation, and more.
eg:
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(np.mean(arr))
print(np.std(arr))

5)Einstein Summation: it is also a good advanced operation
