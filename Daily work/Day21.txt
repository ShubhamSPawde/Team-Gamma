Manim is a free, open-source Python library for creating interactive  animations, originally developed by Grant Sanderson of 3Blue1Brown, a math YouTuber. Manim can be used to create animations for math explanations,graphs and much more by juct some piece of code which is mesmerizing.

Some examples of animations that can be created with Manim include: Creating and hiding objects,converting shapes into other shapes etc.....

It can also be used for more general purposes, such as creating scientific animations. 


It is very usefull as to create some of the difficult graphs we can use it, which in some cases are very hard to make.

I have attached a simple code to create a animation in manim.
