<!-- VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM

Version Control or Source Control is tracking & managing changes made to the software code. Version Control Systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes made to the source code over time.
Version Control Software keeps track of every modification/change made to the code so that if a mistake has occurred the developer can compare the earlier code and try to solve the mistake.

Git is a popular open-source version control system that lets you manage & keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories/folders. When developers work on open-source projects they use Git and GitHub helps to manage them effectively.
Git Commands : 
1.	git clone - clones a repository on our local machine.
2.	git add file name - adds new or changed files in your working directory to the Git staging area.

5.	Git clean - removes untracked files from the working directory.
6.	Git push origin main - uploads local repository content to GitHub repository where origin is the name of local repository & main is the name of branch where you want to upload file contents.
7.	git branch - To check current branch
8.	git branch -M name - To rename branch.
9.	git checkout branch name - To get out of one branch and enter new branch.
10.	git checkout -b new branch name - to create new branch and enter that branch.
11.	git branch -d branch name - to delete branch.
12.	git diff branch name - to compare commits, branches, files & more.
13.	Git merge branch name - To merge 2 branches.
14.	Pull request - It lets you tell others about the changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

Workflow: Github repository --> clone -->  make changes in code --> add to staging area --> commit changes --> push -->
