# Manim is a Python library for creating mathematical animations. Understanding and  solving difficult concepts of mathematics 
# like solving curve equations, volume, surface area problems can be made easy using manim which will visualize these concepts.

# Manim can be installed using pip(python package installer). Open terminal/command prompt and run the command : pip install manim.
# Along with installing manim, install additional packages like LaTex and FFmpeg from MikTex and Ffmpeg’s official websites.
# For verification of the library and packages, On terminal run the commands : 
# manim –version, latex –version, ffmpeg –version
# To Configure, create a file and write a simple python manim code and then open that file in terminal and run the command : 
# manim -pql file_name.py 
# Where pql is picture quality low, quality can be upgraded to pqh(high).
# After the command is executed, the animation video would be generated.
# Example of a manim script : 
# from manim import *    #manim library is being imported
# class Transform(Scene):   #Scene is container for animations
#     def construct(self):
#            circle = Circle()        #circle is defined
#            triangle = Triangle()    #triangle is defined 
#            self.play(Create(circle))      #this creates a circle
#            self.play(Transform(circle, triangle))     #this transforms the circle into triangle
#            self.wait(0.5)     #after the animation a waiting time of 0.5 seconds.

# Ex : 

# class Unique(Scene):
# def construct(self):

# hello_text = Tex("Hello World")
# square = Square().to_edge(DR)
# self.play(Write(hello_text))
# self.play(hello_text.animate.shift(UR * 3))
# self.wait(0.4)
# self.play(Create(square))
# self.wait(0.5)

# axes = Axes(x_range=[-3,3], y_range=[-2,2], axis_config={"color":WHITE}).to_edge(LEFT)
# graph = axes.plot(lambda x: np.sin(x), color=RED)
# self.play(Create(axes))
# self.play(Create(graph))
# self.wait(0.6)
# self.play(FadeOut(hello_text, square, graph, axes))
# self.wait(0.4)
