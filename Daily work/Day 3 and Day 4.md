### Linting, Formatting, and Code Analysis Tools
- **Linting**: 
  - Flake8: Identifies stylistic errors, potential bugs, and code quality issues.
- **Formatting (PEP 8)**: 
  - Black: Automatically reformats code to adhere to PEP 8 standards.
- **Code Analysis**: 
  - MyPy: Static type checker for Python to catch type errors early.

### Techniques and Tools for Effective Debugging
- **Debugging Techniques**:
  - **Breakpoints**: Pause code execution to inspect program state.
  - **Step Through Code**: Execute code line by line to identify issues.
  - **Watch Expressions**: Monitor variables and expressions over time.
- **Debugging Tools**:
  - **Integrated Debuggers**: Built-in debuggers in modern IDEs for breakpoints and variable inspection.
  - **Loggers**: Logging libraries to record execution details for diagnosing issues.
  - **Profilers**: Tools like cProfile to identify performance bottlenecks with detailed reports.
